	<h1>Mocha</h1>

	<p>Mochas are a really great drink to have. I like to have them around Christmas. The best part is that they are super easy to make. All you need is some coffee, cocoa powder, sugar, milk, and optional peppermint extract if you want to make a peppermint mocha. You can also just get them at most coffee shops. Overall, I would really recommend giving them a try.


<h1>Hot Chocolate</h1>

<p>Hot Chocolate is a classic and great drink to have year round. I like to make it in the evenings when I don't have time to make something super complicated but still want a good dessert. Just like a mocha, it is also really simple to make. You just need to warm up milk, cocoa powder, and sugar on a stove. You can also add whipped cream.</p>
