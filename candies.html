	<p>M&M's are my favorite candy. I always get so excited when I get them on Halloween. There are so many kinds! Some of the most notiable ones are peanut, caramel, and chocolate.</p>
	<p>Here is a link to the M&M's website if you want to try them on your own: https://www.mms.com/en-us/mms-candy-flavors/mms-candy-flavors-c.html</p>
	
<h1>Twix</h1>

<p>Twix are another really good chocolate candy. They are chocolate on the outside, but inside they have caramel and biscuit. This creates a fun candy that is crunchy and chewy.</p>
