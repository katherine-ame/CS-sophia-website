	<h1>Croissant</h1>

	<p>The first baked good I want to talk about is croissants! The modern croissant orginated in France, but it is now enjoyed all over the world. A croissant is a savory, flaky pastry often made of butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk. There are many different toppings that you can put in them, such as chocolate, cream, fruits, or different types of nuts.</p>
	<p>Here is a recipe you could use to make croisants at home. Be warned: it can take at least a day to make them! Link to recipe: https://baranbakery.com/easy-croissant-recipe/.</p>

<h1>Cookies</h1>

<p>Cookies are one of the most verstile and tasty treats, which explains why they are so well known and widely liked. Some of the most popular cookies are chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, gingerbread, cookies with frosting, and chocolate cookies. Personally, I love chocolate chip cookies. The only recipe I ever use is the one on the back of the chocolate chip bag, but I'll put a different recipe that is similar to the one I use.</p>
<p>These are great when you want a super quick treat that tastes great! Link to recipe: https://joyfoodsunshine.com/the-most-amazing-chocolate-chip-cookies/#wprm-recipe-container-8678</p>
